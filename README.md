Overview
As a software engineer, I created this mobile app to strengthen my skills in building interactive, user-friendly applications and to gain experience working with modern mobile development tools. The app focuses on delivering a simple and intuitive experience that allows users to quickly generate random selections and interact with the interface in a clean and responsive way.

The app is easy to use: users can open the app, tap a button to generate a random result, and interact with options that refresh dynamically. The layout is designed to be straightforward, making it accessible for anyone to pick up and use immediately.

My purpose in creating this app was to practice mobile UI development, refine my understanding of state management, and explore how to structure small but functional mobile apps that could be expanded with more complex features over time.

Development Environment
This project was developed using Flutter and the Dart programming language. I used Visual Studio Code as my primary development environment, along with various Flutter and Dart extensions to streamline formatting, debugging, and hot reload features.

Key libraries and tools include:
Flutter SDK (for building cross-platform UI)
Dart (main programming language)
Android Studio / AVD Manager (for creating an Android emulator)
Flutter's Material UI components

USEFUL WEBSITES:
Flutter Documentation
Dart Language Tour
Stack Overflow
Flutter by Example

FUTURE WORK
Add more randomization options or categories
Improve UI styling and animations
Implement local data storage for user preferences
Add features such as themes or saved history entries
